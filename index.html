<h3> About Me </h3>
<br>I'm a PhD student at <a href="https://english.iop.cas.cn/pe/faculty/?id=4432">Prof. Fang Jiao's lab</a> at <a href="https://english.iop.cas.cn/">Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences</a>. My research interests lie in single molecule biophysics, especially membrane protein dynamics. I'm also passionate about protein-membrane interactions and their consequent emergent phenomena.<br>
