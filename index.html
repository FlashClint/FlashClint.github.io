<h2> About Me </h2>

I'm a PhD student in <a href="https://english.iop.cas.cn/pe/faculty/?id=4432">Prof. Fang Jiao's lab</a> at <a href="https://english.iop.cas.cn/">Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences</a>. My research interests lie in single molecule biophysics, especially membrane protein dynamics. I'm also passionate about protein-membrane interactions and their consequent emergent phenomena.
In my spare time, I like to play football and watch football matches, especially the Premier League. I support Manchester City in the league. I also enjoy travelling and hiking.
